```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## 1. confidence intervals 

```{r}
otter_length <- c(38, 41, 50, 27, 32, 41, 60, 43)
t.test(otter_length)


```
## t-test (1-sample)
See a claim that the mean otter length is 50 inches

```{r}
otter_test <-t.test(x = otter_length, mu=50)
otter_test

```
## Part 3: two-sample t-test
##defaults to Welch two sample tests, does not assume equal var
```{r}
desert_bighorns <- c(32, 44,18, 26,33,42,20, 50)
sierra_bighorns <- c(28, 31, 40,42,26,29,31)

t.test(x= desert_bighorns, y = sierra_bighorns)
```
